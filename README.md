Move Out!
===========

Tired of that certain-someone who just won't seem to move out? Everything you try they balk at and
reject... we'll fear no more, Move Out! operates as a mediocre system (think of an expert system for
mediocrity) that assists you in finding a place for that certain someone so they can finally move out.


How it Works
--------------

Provide Move Out! with a collection of rules based on various attributes such as location, price, and
description. For example,  

**Price:** *< 500 / month*  
**Description:** *"Shared accomodation"* AND *"Hot Women"*  
**Location:** *"College"*  

and watch as it crawls the far corners of the web searching for that *perfect place*
to kick... ahem, move that certain-someone into.


Possible Features to Add
--------------------------

* Automatically emailing or SMS the person with that *certain-someone's* phone number or email


Supported Websites

At the moment only the following websites are supported, but more will be added when possible.

* Kijiji
* Craig's List
